# Mobile Sales Linear Model Dashboard

A comprehensive data analytics project that explores **mobile sales data** using Python.  
It applies **data cleaning**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **regression modeling**,  
and builds an **interactive Streamlit dashboard** for insights visualization.

## Project Overview

This project walks through the complete data pipeline:

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removes duplicates and missing values  
   - Converts data types for numerical and categorical columns  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Statistical summaries (mean, median, mode, variance, IQR)  
   - Identifies unique categorical values  
   - Visual analysis using Matplotlib and Plotly  

3. **Modeling**
   - **Linear Regression (OLS)** for numeric features  
   - **Ridge Regression (CV)** for regularization and evaluation  
   - **Random Forest Regression** for categorical features and feature importance  

4. **Interactive Dashboard (Streamlit)**
   - Dynamic filters by brand and memory  
   - KPI cards for price, rating, and total count  
   - Visualizations: histograms, bar charts, and top-selling models
